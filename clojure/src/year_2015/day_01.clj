  ;; BEST - Reduce
    (reduce (fn [acc curr]
              (if (= floor-up curr) (inc acc) (dec acc)))
            0
            (seq input))

  ;; BAD - Recursive function
    (defn part-1 [acc coll]
      (println "Looking for appartament on floor:" acc)
      (if (empty? coll)
        (println "The appartament is on floor:" acc)

         (rest coll)))))

;; GOOD - Tail recursion
(defn part-1
  [input]
  (loop [acc 0
         coll (seq input)]
    (println "Looking for appartament on floor:" acc)
